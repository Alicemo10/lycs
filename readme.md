A convenient script to test your server's speed that links to nodes in China

based on [bestrace](http://www.ipip.net)

## Usage
no much things to explain  
cuz it's a script with Chinese language

just one thing... you must run it with `bash`  
like
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanqinlang/testrace/master/testrace.sh
bash testrace.sh
```

it's the best to say nothing !
